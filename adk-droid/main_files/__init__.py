# adk-droid/main_files/__init__.py
# This file makes Python treat the directory 'main_files' as a package.
# It can remain empty.

# Optionally, you could import modules here to make them available directly
# from the package, e.g.:
# from . import config
# from . import connection_manager
# from . import session_manager
# from . import api_models
# from . import dependencies
# from . import api_routes
